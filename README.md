## Hi there 👋
Because my projects are part of the school tasks and projects meaning those can be used to complete or cheat in the tasks and projects, everything is set to private.
If you want to see them, send me an email/request and depending who sent it, I will grant access to them. I need to have your GitHub account to grant the access and I will pick all the relevant projects while leaving out weekly tasks which gives no additional information.
I will check the request so no cheating can be done with these projects.
