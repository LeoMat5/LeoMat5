## Hi there 👋
Because my projects are part of the school tasks and projects meaning those can be used to complete or cheat in the tasks and projects, everything is set to private.
If you want to see them, send me an email/request and depending who sent it, I will grant access to them. 
I need to have your GitHub account to grant the access. Pick the projects and/or task you want to see, and I will grant access depending on who is asking the access.
I will check the request so no cheating can be done with these projects.

The following information will be slowly updated and expanded.

School projects
1. Municipality themed mobile application with Java made on Android studio

3. Municipality themed web application using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Leafletjs, Frappe Charts, APIs
